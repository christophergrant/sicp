; Exercise 6

#| The answer is that the function will not terminate, and end up in an infinite loop. The explanation for this
   can be found by investigating the way in which the scheme interpreter evaluates conditional expressions versus
   "normal" expressions. "Normal" expressions use applicative order, where each argument is evaluated as it is "revealed".
   Conditional statements (like if) are special because they do not necessarily evaluate the predicate, consequent, and alternative.
   Only two of those three MUST be evaluated within the if expression.
